Weather Dashboard

This app pulls weather data from the OpenWeather API and displays it on the page in two places: current weather and a five-day forecast. 

The user can input a city, and the app will pull up weather data for that city and display it on the page. 

The cities the user has previously entered are saved in localStorage and the visible search history to be pulled up again quickly on demand.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API calls.
